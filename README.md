Randomized mv
=============

A simple script to move a file at random with an optional directory-name-based rule system.


Motivation
----------

This is an ongoing productivity experiment to throttle my bookmarks-based reading backlog
and `.txt`-based TODO list.

Scheduling this script to run each morning allows you to move one or more random files from a large collection
to an "inbox" directory, throttling your attention to the list in a predictive way. Using directory name rules,
you can "snooze" files to tomorrow, next month, next year, or even to specific days of the week.

Note that this strategy works best for files that aren't urgent.


Usage
-----

*TODO*
